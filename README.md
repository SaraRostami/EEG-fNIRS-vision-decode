# EEG-fNIRS Vision Decode

## Project Overview
This project investigates how visual information and stimulus memorability are represented in the brain. It integrates **electroencephalography (EEG)** and **functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)** within a multimodal machine learning framework[cite: 1].

## Goals
**Multimodal Integration:** Combine EEG’s high temporal precision with fNIRS’s spatial sensitivity to understand neural dynamics during visual perception.
**Decoding:** Use Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA), specifically SVMs and logistic regression, to decode stimulus category and memorability from neural patterns[cite: 3, 4].
**Encoding:** Implement deep learning models (CNNs and Transformers) to bridge computational visual features with biological neural signals.

## Current Status
Focusing on data preprocessing pipelines for both modalities.
